# Thermostate
Simple thermostate simulation. The application simulates the behaviour of a thermostate. It offers the user the possibility to custom the minimum and maximum temperature that he would like to have in a room. If the temperature is not in the define interval, the cooling or heating functions will be trigered so the temperature in the room will get in the needed interval.
